# train_time

This is the easier version of the seventh assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The application was required to retrieve and manipulate train information with Moment.js and provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
